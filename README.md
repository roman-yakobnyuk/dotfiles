# Dotfiles

This is repo storing all my dotfiles that I used in my environment in day to day basis.

It is constant work in progress as I try to move most of my environments to same base and sync configurations using this repository with best methods I can find.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

Install `fish` shell
```
brew install fish
```

Set `fish` as default shell
```
chsh -s fish
```

# Help

Symlinking

```
