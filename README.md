# Dotfiles

This is repo storing all my dotfiles that I use in my environment in day to day basis.

It is constant work in progress as I try to move most of my environments to same base and sync configurations using this repository with best methods I can find.

## Prerequisites

* Install homebrew


# Useful Notes

Symlinking

```
ln -s /source/file file
```
