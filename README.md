# Dotfiles

This is repo storing all my dotfiles that I use in my environment in day to day basis.

It is constant work in progress as I try to move most of my environments to same base and sync configurations using this repository with best methods I can find.

## Prerequisites

* Install homebrew

## Install Coreutils for Mac OS

To support improved `ls` command, you need to install `coreutils` package using homebrew. If you decide not to use it, you need to update `/bash/.bash_profile` to remove the alias.

To install `coreutils`, use the following command:

```
brew install coreutils
```
